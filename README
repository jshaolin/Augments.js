The Augments.js library is a build in progress, so far I've got Prefix Tries, Binary Trees, Interval Trees, Range Trees, k-d Trees, Red-Black Trees, (a, b) Trees and AVL Trees.
Algorithms include the classic sort algorithm and string algorithms of Ukkonen's algorithm, Wagner–Fischer algorithm, Hunt–McIlroy algorithm and Substring index.
Not ready to upload yet as I'm trying to have a bit more testing and incorporate a few more data structures before uploading the first release.
